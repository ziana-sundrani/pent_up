#Content Moderation

To run the Detoxify model:
   # 1. Login to Supabase (first time only)
   npx supabase login
   
   # 2. Link your project (if not already linked)
   npx supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
   
   # 3. Deploy the function
   npx supabase functions deploy moderate-message
